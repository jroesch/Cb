A compiler for a C like language with ad-hoc polymorphism. Very much a WIP.

The idea is to support a pretty standard Hindley-Milner type inferred langauge similar to bare Haskell98 sans type classes.
Then move on to supporting type classes and further interesting features such as Rank2Types. 

The goal is to make low level C-style code as palpable and safe as possible to write, read and intermix with existing code.
Performance is very much a goal, as well as readable C ouptut.
